                <p>Be it through direct or indirect causes poverty does have an affect on people's health.
                    The chart above show that there is a significant trend between the increase in poverty and the decrease of Physical
                    activty a person engages in. People in more impoverished areas may lack the facilities or the proper equipment
                    to engage in most sporting activities. Also these people are more likely to spend time working to make ends meet, and/or commuting to those jobs.

                <p>
                    An obvious assumption to make from the clear trend that poverty negatively affects physical activity is that it would also be a major indicator in obesity.
                    There may be a correlation, but from the data we assessed there is not a clear correlation between obesity and poverty because obesity is also still very high in less impoverished areas.
